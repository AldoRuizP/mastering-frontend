export default WLayout1

### Apart from the different slides components
## There are two layouts

#### This one has the logo in the middle

---
export default WLayout2

#### And this one has it in the top left corner

---
export default WLayout1

# Presenter mode
### You can have notes that can only be seen in "presenter mode"
#### (alt + P)
<Notes>
This note can only be seen by you, not your audience
</Notes>
---
export default WLayout1

# Pro tip
### Open two browser windows, one with the "presenter mode"
### and the other in "normal mode",
### then use meets/hangouts/zoom to only present
### the normal one while you look at the other window
##### both will sync when you change the slide
<Notes>
and you can use this as a cheat sheet

export default WLayout1

# This is a React component

<Counter/>
<Notes>
  Sadly any interactive component like this one
  won't change it's state in both windows,
  any demo should be worked on the "normal mode" window.

<Codepen url="https://codepen.io/ederdiaz/pen/NBPWZp"/>
<Notes>
  This is a working codepen,
  be careful when clicking the sides as you might change the slide accidentally.
  Also it won't change it's state in both windows,
  any demo should be worked on the "normal mode" window.
