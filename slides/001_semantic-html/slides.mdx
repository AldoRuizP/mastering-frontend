<Notes>
  Raise your hand if you knew less than 20%... more than half... all of these tags!

  Well... one of those doesn't exist.

<Notes>
  Fun fact for the people that thought it was the ruby tag.

  It actually is used mostly in japanese, it attaches an anottation to indicate 
  the pronunciation or meaning of the corresponding characters.

# Auditing your page
### Read your HTML code like you where
### reading a menu of a restaurant or a coffee shop

### Hierarchy
### Well defined sections

---
export default Split

![](./images/menu-beer.jpg)

### It can be more complex
### Even different styled elements 
### are in their semantic section

---
export default WLayout1

### This is how it feels when you read a 
### non semantic HTML code
---
export default Split

![](./images/worst-menu.jpg)

### No Hierarchy
### Confusing sections
---
# Common pitfalls

- The elements are too generic
- Using semantic tags for styling purposes
- Site structure differs from planned

### Apart from the different slides components
## There are two layouts

#### This one has the logo in the middle

---
export default WLayout2

#### And this one has it in the top left corner

---
export default WLayout1

# Presenter mode
### You can have notes that can only be seen in "presenter mode"
#### (alt + P)
<Notes>
This note can only be seen by you, not your audience
</Notes>
---
export default WLayout1

# Pro tip
### Open two browser windows, one with the "presenter mode"
### and the other in "normal mode",
### then use meets/hangouts/zoom to only present
### the normal one while you look at the other window
##### both will sync when you change the slide
<Notes>
and you can use this as a cheat sheet

# This is a React component

<Counter/>
<Notes>
  Sadly any interactive component like this one
  won't change it's state in both windows,
  any demo should be worked on the "normal mode" window.

<Codepen url="https://codepen.io/ederdiaz/pen/NBPWZp"/>
<Notes>
  This is a working codepen,
  be careful when clicking the sides as you might change the slide accidentally.
  Also it won't change it's state in both windows,
  any demo should be worked on the "normal mode" window.
