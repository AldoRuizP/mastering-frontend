# Positioning

The `position` attribute.

<CodeSurfer
  title="Static"
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/static.css")}
  lang="css"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={false}

<Notes>
  The default from browsers

<CodeSurfer
  title="Relative"
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/relative.css")}

  showNumbers={false}

<Notes>
  Starts just as static if we use it alone.
  But if we use positioning properties, the magic happens.

Will react to the following properties:

* `top`
* `bottom`
* `left`
* `right`
* `z-index`

  The element will not remain in the natural flow of the page.
  It will position itself according to the closest positioned ancestor

# Floats

<Notes>
  Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the web page.
  This is distinctly different than page elements that use absolute positioning.
  Absolutely positioned page elements are removed from the flow of the webpage.
</Notes>

---

Floats let us stack things horizontally instead of vertically

<Notes>
  Explain what happens with floats, that they dont affect the height of their parent.
</Notes>

---

“Clearing” a float is when we tell a block to ignore any floats that appear before it.

<Notes>
  “Clearing” a float is when we tell a block to ignore any floats that appear before it.
  Instead of flowing around the floated box, a cleared element always appears after any floats.
  It’s like forcing a box back into the default vertical flow of the page.

# Float exercise to make columns

# Stacking Context

(Or, `z-index` gotcha!)

<Notes>
  Explain that it not only happens with `z-indez` but also with
  other properties, but it's commonly found of when using z-index.
</Notes>

---

<Codepen url="https://codepen.io/TheMightyPenguin/pen/ZqKopB" />

<Notes>
  To begin with, boxes will be stacked following the normal flow of the page.
  That means, the order they were used in the HTML.

  Each stacking context is self-contained: after the element's contents are stacked,
  the whole element is considered in the stacking order of the parent stacking context.
</Notes>

---

Stacking Context are created when an element:
* Is the root element of a document (the `<html>` element)
* Is positioned and a `z-index` value other than `auto`
* Has an opacity value less than 1
* ..... (Check MDN reference for a complete list)

---

# Explain how to use z-index properly and good practices

---

# Flexbox

<Notes>
  Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept
</Notes>

---

<Codepen url="https://codepen.io/TheMightyPenguin/pen/mzmLGZ" />

---

# Flexbox Properties

* `justify-content`: Positions items on the main-axis (horizontal or row by default)
* `align-items`: Positions items on the cross-axis (vertical or column by default)
* `flex-direction`: Swaps the main and cross axes (row by default)

---

# Flexbox Properties

* `flex-grow`: Prioritizes what elements to grow
* `flex-shrink`: Should the element shrink or not?
* `flex-basis`: Initial size or width

---

# Exercise Time!!

<Notes>
  Note: in case both flex-basis (other than auto)
  and width (or height in case of flex-direction: column)
  are set for an element, flex-basis has priority.
