export default WLayout1

### Apart from the different slides components
## There are two layouts

#### This one has the logo in the middle

---
export default WLayout2

#### And this one has it in the top left corner

---
export default WLayout1

# Presenter mode
### You can have notes that can only be seen in "presenter mode"
#### (alt + P)
<Notes>
This note can only be seen by you, not your audience
</Notes>
---
export default WLayout1

# Pro tip
### Open two browser windows, one with the "presenter mode"
### and the other in "normal mode",
### then use meets/hangouts/zoom to only present
### the normal one while you look at the other window
##### both will sync when you change the slide
<Notes>
and you can use this as a cheat sheet
</Notes>
